# LSCI

Local Spectral Conformal Inference for Operator Models

## Overview

`LSCI` implements the Local Spectral Conformal Inference method [1] in JAX. LSCI was developed to implement locally adaptive conformal inference for operator models, allowing them quantify prediction uncertainty in local exchangeable settings, i.e when the distribution changes over time.

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trevor-harris/LSCI
pip install LSCI/
```
### Examples

Forthcoming

### Notes

This package is currently under heavy development. This paper has not yet been peer-reviewed and exists as-is as a preprint currently.
